Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for up to three successive renewal terms of having the same number of full calendar months as the Initial Term (each a ‘Renewal Term’) unless be braver or Customer provides the other with written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then-current Renewal Term, as applicable.
